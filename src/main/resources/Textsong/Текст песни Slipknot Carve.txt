Someone else's telepathy
Collapsed enemy
Always dealing with that and this
I released then I believe
64 elimination
We'll make you understand,
How feel,
Fascination,
I need a gun,
I need a gun to kill,

Your pain I see,

Carve! Theres something inside!
Carve! Theres nothing inside!
Carve! Theres something inside!
Carve! it's not done til over
Carve! Theres something inside!
Carve! Theres nothing inside!
Carve! Theres something inside!
Carve!

Your in your place trapped,
Your gonna get your face slapped,
Bring more,
Slice,dice and penalize,
Gonna get it slam dunk,
You fat ass punk,
You stick your own face,
Yet u can't afford your own place,
I am gonna give you a little more,
Gonna make you wanna to take it,
Thank you anyways,
I am just taking you,

Roll your ass,
Force you to pass,
Least I am not fucked,
Whatcha you going to do,
When god sees through you,
(You are fake)
You want it even louder,
Eyes and ears,
Listen to what we say,
so there is no way to eliminate,
(I want it all!)
I am going to show u how to be deceiving,

SEE!
What your lies have done 
YOU!
You are the one
YOU!
Are in your place trapped
YOUR!
Have gotten retrapped
YOU!
ARE GONE
YOU!
ARE MINE!
YOU!
SHOW YOUR OWN FACE TRAPPED
YOU!
JUST GOT RETRAPPED
CARVE!
