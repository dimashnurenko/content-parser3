why do you hesitate to start
and make excuses for the time you lost
youll never get it back
consequences for your actions
never out way all the things that lay before you
dont think so much, listen
dont wait for this to happen
its hard to imagine
dreams becoming real
this life has strange endings

taking in for granted what you have
its here but you dont really wanna see it
the road lasts forever, forever is here
you could be, but you dont really wanna be
make it what you want and everythings clear
you sat around too long and watched your friends go by
and you're left alone to think and wonder why
but its not too late for you to make a move
time is running out so on your feet
